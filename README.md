This is the Camera Lock assignment for Dr. Klump's Video Game Programming Class
the game can be launched by running the DesktopLauncher file. 
To play the game use W,A,S,D for movemen. J will lock the character to a square 1.5* the size of the player. U will reverse this and free the player. 

If you reach the top or bottom of the map you will be blocked from moving further, if you go left or right off the world you wrap to the other side.
